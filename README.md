# InstagramPyBot

Here is my code. If it's not running on your computer let me know and I can bring mine in for you to run it on. This code successfully asks the user for a country to make an instagram reel on and then uploads that to Instagram using AI-generated content. Dall-e-3 for images, ChatGPT for text prompts, Google TTS for the audio. Instagram password, .json Google TTS API key, and OpenAI API key are all included in this code. I purchased a bunch of credits to run this so it won't run out.

Modules to download: \n
instagrapi
openai
moviepy

Output looks like this:
